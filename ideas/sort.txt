If you need to "hard" sort a table, i.e. you want the table to be sorted in
some predefined order, so that your query doesn't have to do it, use the
following syntax:

alter table `yourtablename` order by `yourfieldname` desc;

In this case, when you execute:

select * from `yourtablename` limit 1;

you get the record for which yourfieldname is the largest.
