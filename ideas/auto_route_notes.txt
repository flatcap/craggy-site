Add tags for volumes as/when necessary

Example:
	Route 37 Red
	Panel 37 tags: wall, arete, volume
	=> notes:
		No hands on aretes
		Hands allowed on volumes
		Feet allowed on volumes

	Route 40 Orange
	Panel 40 tags: slab, arete
	=> notes:
		No hands on arete [tick] -> uncheck this default

	Route 51 Red
	Panel 51 tags: wall
	=> notes:
