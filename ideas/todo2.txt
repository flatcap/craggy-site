get readline test working - tab autocompletion? how?

colo - named - separate log file

500 emails - 367 different hosts

fix local email delivery on muse

hide buttons when no table?

x_error area for completion - use it or lose it
likewise "matches" div

&nbsp; between buttons!

button order

fix colo backup _pull_ on muse

add colo web users to apache group?

standardise *_work.php

don't send <id>U123</id>

paste into field doesn't activate on keyup/down/press => no active button

add tablesorter to edit table?

db.sh check mysql for errors, or empty files & delete them

git update server hook?
cgit docs?

dovecot fail2ban on colo
relay access denied
allow rich+id@flatcap.org

can't enter a features only route without a setter and date

ctrl-s -> save?

multiple climb problem
need to uniquely identify them

check, that if unsorted (by tablesorter), panels are in seq order

---------------------

rather than
        x .= "html"
        x .= "html"
        innerHtml = x;
create table
        x .= "table..."
then
        get tbody
tb.addChild (tr), td, input?

OR

all html -> innerHtml
then iterate through all inputs and attach callbacks

-------------------

can we transform
        php     <->     xml     <->     html
        xml             dom             dom
using xsl?

if I have an error message column in the table, things will get pretty wide

I don't need row numbers

give each row a uniq id (store in tr for convenience)

keep successful routes: message "success" in green

if using xslt, do all the tags *have* to exist?
will a missing tag leave a gap in my table?
probably not.  select value-of will return empty

tr.success -> set of <td>value</td>
tr.failure -> set of <td>value</td>

xslt only needs to assemble/disassemble <table> not entire page

php side, add ids to xml colour_id, grade_id, etc

use autocompletion on the "add climbs" dialog:

type "done" or "commit" in entry box to commit all changes
"save"?  other commands?

ctrl-s from anywhere to save?

colours list in apc_cache ['table_colour']
colour_lookup store as table_colour_1 or _lookup
before using lookup, do cache_get on colour
cache get colour fails (expired), does db_select
before db_select invalidate table_colour* in cache (things dependent on colour)

invalidate
        get list of keys in cache
        delete matches

what if if depends on several tables?

---------------------------------


route:
        id, row, panel, colour, grade, setter, date, notes, message

if all successful, green box *12 new routes created* link to routes table
http://craggy.russon.org/routes.php?highlight=34-36,38

some successful, orange box *4 new routes created*, however
list of errors
Num 4:
        msg1...
        msg2...
Num 6:
        msg1...
        etc

xml from add_work
        ok      <colour>red</colour>
        fail    <grade type='invalid'>6s</grade>

clear successful routes?

on failed routes, reaplce table data with reply from php
sync would be good, but just replacing the table would be simpler

how should I renumber the ros?  In route_data they correspond to the index?
change the id column heading to Row -> clear success, renumber rows, display warnings

OR

leave successful routes in place
        sync data / rebuild table
        success routes are RO   }
        failed routes are RW    } colour difference?

on resend only send routes that haven't been committed (keep track in the <tr>)
php needs to maintain the row number

select current climbs / routes -> date_end is null, active is not null - irrelevant if joining
