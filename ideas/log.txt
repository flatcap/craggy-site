As of MySQL 5.1.12, you can rename the general query log file at runtime by disabling the log:

SET GLOBAL general_log = 'OFF';

With the log disabled, rename the log file externally; for example, from the
command line. Then enable the log again:

SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';

This method works on any platform and does not require a server restart.

The session sql_log_off variable can be set to ON or OFF to disable or enable
general query logging for the current connection.
