53 all(d) clean
23 rd,pk,wh(d) clean
panel number
colours comma/whitespace separated

	(f)	fail
	(s)	success
	(c)	clean (default)
	(n)	nice

keep an undo buffer

for new routes, queue the changes

	add routes grid - editable [tick] remove from list
	commit changes button -> update db; create rss!
	backup data first?

eliminate the views?
make them more useful?

make all db queries go through one function
then log everything
then time everything
