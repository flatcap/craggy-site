some examples of queries that are very fast:

select count(*) from tbl_name;

select min(key_part1),max(key_part1) from tbl_name;

select max(key_part2) from tbl_name
  where key_part1=constant;

select ... from tbl_name
  order by key_part1,key_part2,... limit 10;

select ... from tbl_name
  order by key_part1 desc, key_part2 desc, ... limit 10;
