craggy_climb isn't normalised

	climb	id
		climber_id
		route_id
		date_climbed
		success_id

However - these refer to the route
	nice
	onsight
	difficulty_id

put them in a new table: (called what?)
	id
	climber_id
	route_id
	nice
	onsight
	difficulty_id

What about notes:
	Are they _climb_ notes? - what I thought about the climb?
	Are they _route_ notes? - what I thought about the route?

Why not both?  Confusing

craggy_{setter,climber} are both people - coalesce

craggy_person
	id
	first_name
	surname
	nickname	- for setters: if nickname, else generate initials
