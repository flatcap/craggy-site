Craggy

crontab backup of russon.org/sql

split stats.php into several named php files

symlink conf.php from somewhere else?

remove onsight, generate it

nice -> star

to update routes
	correction	overwrite row
	deletion	set date clear
			set climbs as old
	new		add route

add/del route
add/del climb

addclimb
	abbr -> colour id
	panel -> route id, col id
	routes -> route ids
	decode success
	decode comments
	add to climbs

google import
colours lower case

add/del climbs/routes need to work from command line, too

start collecting climbs stats - crontab

custom craggy 404 /redirect

route/climb abbr decoder

date on rss feed
table for rssdata = create_rss.php

fewest_climbs.php
a list of the routes I've climbed the least

data for climbing rate
climbs/week/month/year
total ascent
mean grade

rd,blu,gn, description for all
rd desc, blu, gn  description for red only

recalculate scores/stats at 4am

add/remove
	colour
	setter
	grade
	panel
	etc

rss of new climbs + stats

how do we determine the "best" climb?
	highest success value?

list all climbs (best available)
	put a "+" if multiple climbs exist
	+ expands the table to show all climbs of that route

46 rd(d) clean "desc" - date
53 all(d) clean
23 rd,pk,wh(d) clean
panel number
colours comma/whitespace separated
colour suffix
	(d)	down
	(f)	fail
	(s)	success
	(c)	clean (default)
	(n)	nice
	ability to combine multiple letters?
	only need to combine success + nice
"text"	description
date

move schema into craggy git

.bashrc - when running git shell, do nothing

singularise tables
	climbs -> climb
	v_routes -> v_route

db: check all the compulsory fields are NOT NULL

db compare
	download the text versions of all the pages on
	russon and flatcap and compare them

change db column names to something distinct, e.g. craggy_*

make reldir in utils.php a bit smarter

utils.php format_string{,2} aren't used

remove mark or make it smarter

how do I mass delete?
	x=1 or x=2 or x=3
	x in [1,2,3]

test cascade on delete

calculate how many climbs will be deleted

keep an undo buffer

create a setter-input-matcher
	matcher on name or initials

for new routes, queue the changes
	delete routes grid  [tick] remove from list button
	add routes grid - editable [tick] remove from list
	commit changes button -> update db; create rss!
	backup data first?

test NULL foreign keys

cascade delete on routes
