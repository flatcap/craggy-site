Multi-Level Ideas / Notes

without weighting the rope?
slightly loose rope?
	proper explanation for instructors

sign off climbs with initials and grade (RR 5+)

take part in a climbing competition

Trust, Bronze, Silver, Gold => four levels (Platinum?)
other names, Beginner, Advanced, Elite, etc could be more?

Learn and remember - Once you're learned a fact/technique,
should know it / be able to demonstrate it, thereafter

reduce number of climbs for each section
and only sign off _best_two_ climbs
	doesn't penalise the slower climbers
	better climbers can focus on quality not quantity
